# My Portfolio

## Overview

This is my portfolio webiste for displaying my technical skills that I have learnt so far at Coder Academy. I am currently still developing the website, so I will keep updating this readme in regards to change/updates I make.
The targeted audience for this webisite is potential employers.

## Components

### Header

Header is complete, position is how I want, text size adjusts depending on screen size. Added line to seperate nav bar and page content.

### Footer

Completed footer design. Now have logo images of, github, linkedin and youtube, which create another tab in browser thats opens there associated websites. Also added copyright at the bottom of each page.

### Homepage

The homepage contains a simple Introduction message, with "about" and "contact" highlighted, which are links to their associated pages.

### About

Finished the content on the page and linked mock resume. Finished styling. This page contains a brief paragraph about myself. And the languages/technologies I currently know.

### Blog Page

Completed and styled the main blog page, happy with how it reacts to various screen sizes. Changed Blog pictures to match the blog names. Clicking the Blog pictures takes you to each individual blog page.

### Contact Page

This page contains a conact form, for potential employers to get in touch. This requires a name, email, subject and a breif message.

### Individual Blog Pages

Completed all the blog pages, used display: grid; to layout the weboages how I wanted them for laptop size screens, then used display flex to change the layout for tablet/mobile so its more user friendly.
Each page displays a picture related to the Blog topic, a heading/date and the blog content itself.

## Styling

### Components (Styling)

This contains the styling of my individual components.
Footer and Header styling is complete. happy with how they both react to different screen sizes.

### Defaults

This contains my default variables, in this case just color.

### Pages

All the pages have a common theme of styling, a basic and modern feel. I kept it basic to not overwhelm myself for my first ever project, but still aimed to meet all assignment criteria.

## Sitemap
