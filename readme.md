## Overview

This is my portfolio webiste for displaying my technical skills that I have learnt so far at Coder Academy. I am currently still developing the website, so I will keep updating this readme in regards to change/updates I make. Since  this is my first website, I decided to keep the design simple. As I learn new technologies, I plan to update this website accordingly.
The targeted audience for this webisite is potential employers.

## Tech Stack

Here is a list of the different technologies used to develop and deploy my website.

- HTML
- CSS
- SCSS
- Markdown
- Netlify
- VS Code

## Components

### Header

For now, the Header is complete, the position is how I want, text size adjusts depending on screen size. Added line to seperate nav bar and page content by using border-bottom. This header will be used on all pages.

### Footer

Completed footer design. Now have logo images of, github, linkedin and youtube, which create another tab in browser thats opens there associated websites. Also added copyright at the bottom of each page. This footer will be used on all pages.

### Homepage

The homepage contains a simple Introduction message, with "about me" and "contact me" highlighted, which are links to their associated pages.

### About

The about page contains a small paragraph about me, which includes some of my strengths, previous work and my hobbies outside of work/ Coder Academy. I have also listed the languages/ktechnologies I have learnt so far at Coder Academy. At the end of the page I have included a link, which currently takes you to a PDF of a Mock Resume.

### Blog Page

The main Blog page is pretty simple, it contains An image that is relevent to the each blogs "content", a title and date for each blog. Clicking each image will take you to each individual blog post. I gave each image a border radius, as it looks a lot cleaner than a squared edge.

### Contact Page

This page contains a contact form, for potential employers to get in touch. This requires a name, email, subject and a breif message. The message input box allows for long messages to be sent. The submit button changes color when you hover over it, which is a good user friendly feature, but also visually appealing.

### Individual Blog Pages

Completed all the blog pages, used display: grid; to layout the webpages how I wanted them for laptop sized screens, then used display flex to change the layout for tablet/mobile so its more user friendly.
Each page displays a picture related to the Blog topic, a heading/date and the blog content itself. For the purpose of this assignment I used Lorem Ipsum.

## Styling

### Components (Styling)

This contains the styling of my individual components.
Both the Footer and Header are used on every page of the website, so if I alter either scss file, it will change on all pages..

### Defaults

This contains my default variables, in this case just colors.

### Pages

All the pages have a common theme of styling, a basic and modern feel. I kept it basic to not overwhelm myself for my first ever project, but still aimed to meet all assignment criteria.

## Sitemap

![Sitemap](./docs/Sitemap.jpg "sitemap")

As you can see from my original sitemap, I originally decided to have to have my github, linkedin and youtube links of the about page. but whilst building the website I decided to place the Github/Linkedin/youtube Links on the footer of my website.
